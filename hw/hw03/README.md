##  Who am I?
I am a British engineer currently working on a green energy project using kites to [generate power](https://www.kitepowersolutions.com). This project is based in the UK, so I have a fair bit of travel as I live in Seattle with my wife, who works for [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com), and my 2 year old son.
## Kites for energy
I work with some super smart coders on the kite energy project who write most of our simulations in Scala, but do a fair bit of analysis in Matlab and Python, and I wanted to be able to contribute a lot more to that side of the project as well as learn to code in a more rigorus fashion. My current techniques consit of hacking bits of other peoples code to try and do what I want with largely disappointing results:  hence the Python course.
## More Kites
Before getting involved in using kites for energy production, I travelled around the world designing and testing kitesurfing kites which was basically getting paid to do fun stuff, but sadly those days are gone.....
